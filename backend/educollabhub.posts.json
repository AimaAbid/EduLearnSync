To recap, in an AiTM attack, the attacker sits in between the user and the real web page and steals a user’s valid session cookies. This means that they can bypass traditional authentication controls.</p><p>Talos, Cisco’s Threat Intelligence Group, reported on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.talosintelligence.com/seaturtle/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(1, 117, 162);\">AiTM attacks</a>&nbsp;back in 2019 as a method to steal user credentials and most recently in the blog, ‘<a href=\"https://blog.talosintelligence.com/how-are-attackers-trying-to-bypass-mfa/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(1, 117, 162);\">How are attackers trying to bypass MFA?</a>’ AiTM attacks are a real concern for many organizations as they are difficult to prevent and on the rise.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2023\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(1, 117, 162);\">Microsoft also found</a>&nbsp;that domains associated AiTM phishing quadrupled from 2022 to 2023.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(73, 80, 87);\">The strongest Duo protection against AiTM attacks is to use phishing–resistant authentication based on WebAuthn standards, paired with Duo’s&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://duo.com/product/device-trust/trusted-endpoints\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(1, 117, 162); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Trusted Endpoints</a><span style=\"color: rgb(73, 80, 87);\">&nbsp;device trust policy. When the user authenticates using passwordless, it creates a keypair where the private key to unlock application access is stored in the device itself (and cannot be intercepted). Additionally, Trusted Endpoints, which prevents unknown or unmanaged devices from accessing applications, stores the trusted user’s registration in the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for Windows devices, or Secure Enclave for Mac. By utilizing security on the device itself, this protects the user from an AiTM attack.</span></p><p><br></p><h2><strong style=\"color: rgb(106, 191, 75);\">﻿Secure Access vs. AiTM</strong></h2><p>So, how does this new protocol protect against AiTM? When a user enrolls in Secure Access, a certificate is issued to that device for that user. It also generates a private key, stored in the TPM or Secure Enclave. This private key will never leave the hardware bubble and will always be associated with that user on that device.</p><p>The user is re-issued a new certificate every few weeks, which rotates the private key on the device. In addition, the mechanism called Demonstration of Proof of Possession (DPoP) helps tie the user identity to device.</p><p>When a user logs into&nbsp;<a href=\"https://duo.com/product/single-sign-on-sso\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(1, 117, 162);\">Duo Single Sign-On</a>&nbsp;and does a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://duo.com/blog/the-beer-drinkers-guide-to-saml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(1, 117, 162);\">SAML authentication</a>, that user gets a cookie to enable the user session. DPoP creates a private keypair on the device and then binds the cookie with the device bound credential. Every time the user presents the cookie, they have to present the DPoP public key. That means that no attacker in the middle can intercept the trusted user’s cookie and reuse it for malicious purposes.</p><p>Essentially, both Duo and Secure Access utilize the most secure part of the device to broker trust between you and the sensitive applications you are accessing, thwarting traditional AiTM attacks. This demonstrates the value of a layered approach, to protect your organization’s resources and provide tools to secure users without getting in the way of business.</p>",

But progress is now being made on multiple levels.</p><p>“There’s a need to become more sustainable and efficient at scales that weren’t possible before,” according to Ester.</p><p>Rules and regulations are being established that are driving data centers to be more energy efficient and advance sustainability, and the computing platforms that fuel those data centers are playing an active role in enabling these improvements.</p><h2>Driving efficiency and sustainability at stakeholder, facility, and platform levels</h2><p>Aiming to be climate-neutral by 2050, the European Union (EU) is confronting the energy crisis directly. EU standards, requirements, and other initiatives—such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-news-and-updates/eu-code-conduct-data-centres-towards-more-innovative-sustainable-and-secure-data-centre-facilities-2023-09-05_en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(1, 117, 162);\">EU Code of Conduct for Data Centres</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency-targets-directive-and-rules/energy-efficiency-directive_en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(1, 117, 162);\">EU Energy Efficiency Directive (EED)</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://standards.cencenelec.eu/dyn/www/f?p=CENELEC:110:0::::FSP_PROJECT:76716&amp;cs=1E4FD332C27DD59C75A9A0A875E4A72E0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(1, 117, 162);\">EN 50600</a>—are aimed at improving energy efficiency, reducing energy consumption, and advancing sustainability.</p><p>Not only are these regulations compelling enterprises to rethink and revise their operations, but they are also spurring innovation and new business models.</p><p>ClusterPower, for example, built the largest data center facility in Romania with sustainability in mind. It is the first in Southeastern Europe with dual Tier III certifications, and has its own microgrid that produces energy from gas and hydrogen. The facility even recovers heat generated from its technology systems, which is then used to cool those same systems via an innovative process.

  "title": "What is Ethical Hacking?",
  "subject": "",
  "bodySection": "<p>Hacking news regularly sends shockwaves through the business community and everyday consumers alike.</p><p><br></p><p>A 2013 Yahoo breach saw more than 1 billion Yahoo accounts hacked, with personal information, details and sensitive data exposed. Over 1,000 Wendy’s franchises were hacked when cybercriminals accessed payment processors, and with them, thousands of customers’ credit card numbers and other information. And there are countless other examples like these.</p><p><br></p><p>While criminal hacking is always in the news, ethical hacking often goes unnoticed or is misunderstood. Ethical hackers are computer and networking experts who try to penetrate systems to find vulnerabilities. They are hacking into systems upon the request of their owners to test their security and keep malicious hackers from accessing their information first.</p><p><br></p><p>Ethical hacking isn’t new, though it has transformed rapidly as new technologies and the IoT evolve.</p><p><br></p><p>A modern approach to ethical hacking came in the 1970s when the U.S. government used “red teams” to hack into its own computer systems to test vulnerabilities.</p><p><br></p><p>In this article:</p><p><br></p><p>Ethical Hacking vs Traditional Hacking</p><p>Why Ethical Hacking?</p><p>How Do Ethical Hackers Work?</p><p>How to Learn More</p><p>Ethical Hackers to Know</p><p>Ethical Hacking Companies</p><p>Ethical Hacking Blogs</p><p>Hacker Training Courses</p><p>Certification Programs</p><p>Ethical Hacking vs Traditional Hacking</p><p>Ethical Hacking</p><p><br></p><p>The idea may sound counterintuitive, but ethical hackers can actually empower small businesses for the better by using their skills for good. Unlike malicious hackers, ethical hackers purposefully break into servers and online systems to expose vulnerabilities so companies can fix them before they spiral and cause catastrophic data loss or financial damage.</p><p><br></p><p>Some ethical hackers are doing it for the satisfaction and challenge, and others come from robust IT backgrounds with a focus on digital security. Meanwhile, traditional hackers are usually hacking into systems illegally for fun, profit or even revenge.</p><p><br></p><p>There are many misconceptions and challenges ethical hackers must overcome in order to gain a reputable foothold in the business world. Many hear the word “hacking” and envision entire computers being taken down and sensitive information released to the world, or recall major hacks like Sony’s when information on thousands of personal computers, servers, and devices was compromised, erased or released to the public.</p><p><br></p><p>Why Ethical Hacking?</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Hacking has quickly spiraled into an unavoidable and costly problem for almost all small businesses. According to a recent HSB Cyber Study, 90% of businesses experienced hacking incidents over the last year.</p><p><br></p><p>The study also found risk managers are worried about the safety and security of IoT devices, and the vulnerabilities exposed with the rise of hyper-connectivity. Only 28% said IoT devices are actually safe for business use, yet 56% of businesses already use them or plan to in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>Using a firewall and regularly updating passwords are just the first steps to enhancing security – but they won’t keep hackers from penetrating business systems. Unfortunately, even complicated passwords can be cracked and are often subject to poor security practices, like storing them on a company server or computer that is also susceptible to being hacked. Hackers are also getting more sophisticated, using emerging technology, holding data for ransom and causing catastrophic damage to small businesses and corporations alike.</p><p><br></p><p>Big corporations like Google pay ethical hackers upwards of $20,000 to look for bugs and flaws through their “Bug Hunter University,” with a comprehensive breakdown of which bugs yield which rewards and payouts. These ethical hackers are helping prevent catastrophic damage to the corporation and protecting its users by catching vulnerabilities before malicious hackers find them.</p><p><br></p><p>Fortunately, small businesses don’t necessarily need to shell out $20,000 to attract their own ethical hackers, and can instead look for professionals ranging from self-taught to tested and certified.</p><p><br></p><p>How Do Ethical Hackers Work?</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Modern-day ethical hackers often started hacking for the challenge or to educate themselves on the vulnerabilities in information technology security. These hackers are sometimes called “white hat hackers.” It’s becoming increasingly common for companies large and small to employ their own in-house Information Security Analysts to help combat hacking. Information Security Analysts typically have extensive training in technological and informational infrastructure, with ongoing responsibilities to keep it all running securely.</p><p><br></p><p>Ethical hackers coming from this area of expertise also have knowledge in problem-solving strategies for security breaches and can collect and analyze data to monitor and interpret weaknesses. Expect them to possess deep knowledge of the latest infrastructure and hardware, from routers to memory storage, with the ability to establish security policies and best practices.</p><p><br></p><p>Information Security Analyst skills are highly valuable and sought out by juggernaut corporations like IBM. For example, a job posting from IBM specifically asks for candidates skilled in ethical hacking who can participate in technical testing for exposed applications.</p><p><br></p><p>Ethical hackers sometimes fall into the category of ‘penetration testers.’ According to Cyber Degrees, penetration testers look for security vulnerabilities across web-based applications, networks, and online systems. They use a variety of methods to hack into systems, from designing and creating their own tools, to employing social engineering.</p><p><br></p><p>The latter is often responsible for data breaches and relies on poor passwords, weak security and even scouring social media to gather personal information to password-test. That means technology and hacking tools are only part of the equation, and thoroughly educating businesses on security policies and best practices is necessary to create safe environments.</p><p><br></p><p>Ethical Hackers to Know</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Today’s ethical hackers have meticulously built a reputation for their skills and ethical behavior in the industry. For example, Ty Miller serves as the Director of Threat Intelligence. The penetration company uses ethical hacking to test vulnerabilities and detect malicious activity. Miller also has a background as a Security Officer and Chief Technology Officer for companies including Macquarie University and Pure Hacking.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Neil R. Wyler (a.k.a. Grifter) is a Threat Hunting and Incident Response Specialist with a reputation for speaking and writing about hacking and how to keep companies safe. He’s spoken for audiences at conferences and events like Black Hat Security Briefings, DEFCON, RSA Conference, CactusCon, B-Sides and more.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The Director of NotSoSecure, Sumit “Sid” Siddharth, has a background in penetration testing, vulnerability research, and signature development, and offers public speaking at conferences like DEFCON. Siddarth is also an IT Security Consultant and trains others on areas integral to ethical hacking, like Infrastructure Penetration Testing.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

  "title": "What is social engineering?",
  "subject": "",
  "bodySection": "<p><em>Social engineering attacks manipulate people into sharing information that they shouldn’t share, downloading software that they shouldn’t download, visiting websites they shouldn’t visit, sending money to criminals or making other mistakes that compromise their personal or organizational security.</em></p><p><br></p><p>An <strong>email that seems to be from a trusted coworker requesting sensitive information</strong>, a threatening voicemail claiming to be from the IRS and an offer of riches from a foreign potentate are just a few examples of social engineering. Because social engineering uses psychological manipulation and exploits human error or weakness rather than technical or digital system vulnerabilities, it is sometimes called \"human hacking.\"</p><p><br></p><p><em>Cybercriminals frequently use social engineering tactics to obtain personal data or financial information, including login credentials, credit card numbers, bank account numbers and Social Security numbers.</em> They use the information that they have stolen for identity theft, enabling them to make purchases using other peoples’ money or credit, apply for loans in someone else’s name, apply for other peoples’ unemployment benefits and more. But a social engineering attack can also be the first stage of a larger-scale cyberattack. </p><p><br></p><p>Social engineering is attractive to cybercriminals because it enables them to access digital networks, devices and accounts without having to do the difficult technical work of getting around firewalls, antivirus software and other cybersecurity controls. This is one reason why social engineering is the leading cause of network compromise today according to ISACA's State of Cybersecurity 2022 report (link resides outside ibm.com). According to IBM's Cost of a Data Breach 2024 report, breaches caused by social engineering tactics (such as phishing and business email compromise) were among the most costly.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>How and why social engineering works</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>Social engineering tactics and techniques are grounded in the science of human motivation. They manipulate victims’ emotions and instincts in ways proven to drive people to take actions that are not in their best interests.</p><p><br></p><p>Most social engineering attacks employ one or more of the following tactics:</p><p><br></p><p>Posing as a trusted brand: Scammers often impersonate or \"spoof\" companies that victims know, trust and perhaps do business with often or regularly—so regularly that they follow instructions from these brands reflexively, without taking the proper precautions. Some social engineering scammers use widely available kits for staging fake websites that resemble those of major brands or companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Posing as a government agency or authority figure</strong>: People trust, respect or fear authority (in varying degrees). Social engineering attacks play on these instincts with messages that appear or claim to be from government agencies (example: the FBI or IRS), political figures or even celebrities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Inducing fear or a sense of urgency:</strong> People tend to act rashly when scared or hurried. Social engineering scams can use any number of techniques to induce fear or urgency in victims. For instance, telling the victim that a recent credit transaction was not approved, that a virus has infected their computer, that an image used on their website violates a copyright and so on. Social engineering can also appeal to victims’ fear of missing out (FOMO), which creates a different kind of urgency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Appealing to greed: </strong>The Nigerian Prince scam, an email wherein someone claiming to be a Nigerian royal trying to flee his country offers a giant financial reward in exchange for the recipient’s bank account information or a small advance fee, is one of the best-known examples of social engineering that appeals to greed. This type of social engineering attack can also come from an alleged authority figure and creates a sense of urgency, which is a powerful combination. This scam is as old as email itself, but was still raking in USD 700,000 per year as of 2018.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Appealing to helpfulness or curiosity</strong>: Social engineering ploys can also appeal to victims’ better nature. For instance, a message that appears to be from a friend or a social networking site can offer technical help, ask for participation in a survey, claim that the recipients’ post has gone viral and provide a spoofed link to a fake website or malware download.</p><p><br></p><h2>Types of social engineering attacks</h2><p><br></p><p><strong>Phishing</strong></p><p>Phishing attacks are digital or voice messages that try to manipulate recipients into sharing sensitive information, downloading malicious software, transferring money or assets to the wrong people or taking some other damaging actions. Scammers craft phishing messages to look or sound like they come from a trusted or credible organization or individual—sometimes, even an individual the recipient knows personally.</p><p><br></p><p>There are many types of phishing scams:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Bulk phishing emails</strong> are sent to millions of recipients at a time. They appear to be sent by a large, well-known business or organization, such as a national or global bank, a large online retailer, a popular online payments provider and so on, and make a generic request such as \"we’re having trouble processing your purchase, please update your credit information.\" Frequently, these messages include a malicious link that takes the recipient to a fake website that captures the recipient’s username, password, credit card data and more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Spear phishing ta</strong>rgets a specific individual, typically one with privileged access to user information, the computer network or corporate funds. A scammer will research the target, often using information that is found on LinkedIn, Facebook or other social media to create a message that appears to come from someone the target knows and trusts or that refers to situations with which the target is familiar. Whale phishing is a spear phishing attack that targets a high-profile individual, such as a CEO or political figure. In business email compromise (BEC), the hacker uses compromised credentials to send email messages from an authority figure’s actual email account, making the scam that much more difficult to detect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Voice phishing or vishing</strong>, is phishing that is conducted through phone calls. Individuals typically experience vishing in the form of threatening recorded calls claiming to be from the FBI.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>SMS phishing, </strong>or smishing, is phishing through a text message.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Search engine phishing</strong> involves hackers creating malicious websites that rank high in search results for popular search terms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Angler phishing</strong> is phishing using fake social media accounts that masquerade as the official accounts of trusted companies’ customer service or customer support teams.</p><p><br></p><p>According to the IBM Security X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2023, phishing is the leading malware infection vector, identified in 41% of all incidents. According to the Cost of a Data Breach 2024 report, phishing is the initial attack vector leading to the most costly data breaches.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Baiting</strong></p><p>Baiting lures (no pun intended) victims into knowingly or unwittingly giving up sensitive information or downloading malicious code by tempting them with a valuable offer or even a valuable object.</p><p><br></p><p>The Nigerian Prince scam is probably the best-known example of this social engineering technique. More current examples include free but malware-infected games, music or software downloads. But some forms of baiting are barely artful. For example, some threat actors leave malware-infected USB drives where people will find them, grab them and use them because \"hey, free USB drive.\"</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tailgating</strong></p><p>In tailgating, also called \"piggybacking\", an unauthorized person closely follows an authorized person into an area containing sensitive information or valuable assets. Tailgating can be conducted in person, for example, a threat actor can follow an employee through an unlocked door. But tailgating can also be a digital tactic, such as when a person leaves a computer unattended while still logged in to a private account or network.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Pretexting</strong></p><p>In pretexting, the threat actor creates a fake situation for the victim, and poses as the right person to resolve it. Very often (and most ironically) the scammer claims that the victim has been impacted by a security breach, and then offers to fix things if the victim will provide important account information or control over the victim’s computer or device. Technically speaking, almost every social engineering attack involves some degree of pretexting.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Quid pro quo</strong></p><p>In a quid pro quo scam, hackers dangle a desirable good or service in exchange for the victim’s sensitive information. Fake contest winnings or seemingly innocent loyalty rewards (\"thank your for your payment, we have a gift for you\") are examples of quid pro quo ploys.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Scareware</strong></p><p>Also considered a form of malware, scareware is software that uses fear to manipulate people into sharing confidential information or downloading malware. Scareware often takes the form of a fake law enforcement notice accusing the user of a crime, or a fake tech support message warning the user of malware on their device.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Watering hole attack</strong></p><p>From the phrase \"somebody poisoned the watering hole\", hackers inject malicious code into a legitimate web page that is frequented by their targets. Watering hole attacks are responsible for everything, from stolen credentials to unwitting drive-by ransomware downloads.</p><p><br></p><p>Social engineering defenses</p><p><br></p><p>Social engineering attacks are notoriously difficult to prevent because they rely on human psychology rather than technological pathways. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/topics/attack-surface\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 98, 254);\">attack surface</a>&nbsp;is also significant: In a larger organization, it takes just one employee's mistake to compromise the integrity of the entire enterprise network. Some of the steps that experts recommend to mitigate the risk and success of social engineering scams include:</p><ul><li>Security awareness training: Many users don't know how to identify social engineering attacks. In a time when users frequently trade personal information for goods and services, they don’t realize that surrendering seemingly mundane information, such as a phone number or date of birth, can allow hackers to breach an account. Security awareness training, combined with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-security\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 98, 254);\">data security</a>&nbsp;policies, can help employees understand how to protect their sensitive data and how to detect and respond to social engineering attacks in progress.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Access control policies: Secure access control policies and technologies, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/topics/multi-factor-authentication\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 98, 254);\">multi-factor authentication</a>, adaptive authentication and a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/topics/zero-trust\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 98, 254);\">zero trust</a>&nbsp;security approach can limit cybercriminals' access to sensitive information and assets on the corporate network even if they obtain users' login credentials.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Cybersecurity technologies: Spam filters and secure email gateways can prevent some phishing attacks from reaching employees in the first place. Firewalls and antivirus software can mitigate the extent of any damage done by attackers who gain access to the network. Keeping operating systems updated with the latest patches can also close some vulnerabilities that attackers exploit through social engineering. Additionally, advanced detection and response solutions, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/topics/edr\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 98, 254);\">endpoint detection and response (EDR)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/topics/xdr\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 98, 254);\">extended detection and response (XDR)</a>, can help security teams quickly detect and neutralize security threats that infect the network through social engineering tactics.</li></ul>",

  "bodySection": "<h2><strong>Hacking—Definition, Types, Security, and More</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>A commonly used hacking definition is the act of compromising digital devices and networks through unauthorized access to an account or computer system. Hacking is not always a malicious act, but it is most commonly associated with illegal activity and data theft by cyber criminals.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>But what is hacking in a cyber security context?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Hacking in cyber security refers to the misuse of devices like computers, smartphones, tablets, and networks to cause damage to or corrupt systems, gather information on users, steal data and documents, or disrupt data-related activity.</p><p><br></p><p>A traditional view of hackers is a lone rogue programmer who is highly skilled in coding and modifying computer software and hardware systems. But this narrow view does not cover the true technical nature of hacking. Hackers are increasingly growing in sophistication, using stealthy attack methods designed to go completely unnoticed by cybersecurity software and IT teams. They are also highly skilled in creating attack vectors that trick users into opening malicious attachments or links and freely giving up their sensitive personal data.</p><p><br></p><p>As a result, modern-day hacking involves far more than just an angry kid in their bedroom. It is a multibillion-dollar industry with extremely sophisticated and successful techniques.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>History of hacking and hackers</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>Hacking first appeared as a term in the 1970s but became more popular through the next decade. An article in a 1980 edition of Psychology Today ran the headline “The Hacker Papers” in an exploration of computer usage's addictive nature. Two years later, two movies, Tron and WarGames, were released, in which the lead characters set about hacking into computer systems, which introduced the concept of hacking to a wide audience and as a potential national security risk.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough, later that year, a group of teenagers cracked the computer systems of major organizations like Los Alamos National Laboratory, Security Pacific Bank, and Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. A Newsweek article covering the event became the first to use the word “hacker” in the negative light it now holds.</p><p><br></p><p>This event also led Congress to pass several bills around computer crimes, but that did not stop the number of high-profile attacks on corporate and government systems. Of course, the concept of hacking has spiraled with the release of the public internet, which has led to far more opportunities and more lucrative rewards for hacking activity. This saw techniques evolve and increase in sophistication and gave birth to a wide range of types of hacking and hackers.</p><p><br></p><p>Considerations when Making a Cybersecurity Investment</p><p><br></p><p>A checklist of things to keep in mind when making a cybersecurity purchase decision.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Types of Hacking/Hackers</h3><p><br></p><p>There are typically four key drivers that lead to bad actors hacking websites or systems: (1) financial gain through the theft of credit card details or by defrauding financial services, (2) corporate espionage, (3) to gain notoriety or respect for their hacking talents, and (4) state-sponsored hacking that aims to steal business information and national intelligence. On top of that, there are politically motivated hackers—or hacktivists—who aim to raise public attention by leaking sensitive information, such as Anonymous, LulzSec, and WikiLeaks.</p><p><br></p><p>A few of the most common types of hackers that carry out these activities involve:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Black hat hackers</strong></p><p>Black hat hackers are the \"bad guys\" of the hacking scene. They go out of their way to discover vulnerabilities in computer systems and software to exploit them for financial gain or for more malicious purposes, such as to gain reputation, carry out corporate espionage, or as part of a nation-state hacking campaign.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>These individuals’ actions can inflict serious damage on both computer users and the organizations they work for. They can steal sensitive personal information, compromise computer and financial systems, and alter or take down the functionality of websites and critical networks.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>White hat hackers</strong></p><p>White hat hackers can be seen as the “good guys” who attempt to prevent the success of black hat hackers through proactive hacking. They use their technical skills to break into systems to assess and test the level of network security, also known as ethical hacking. This helps expose vulnerabilities in systems before black hat hackers can detect and exploit them.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The techniques white hat hackers use are similar to or even identical to those of black hat hackers, but these individuals are hired by organizations to test and discover potential holes in their security defenses.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Grey hat hackers</strong></p><p>Grey hat hackers sit somewhere between the good and the bad guys. Unlike black hat hackers, they attempt to violate standards and principles but without intending to do harm or gain financially. Their actions are typically carried out for the common good. For example, they may exploit a vulnerability to raise awareness that it exists, but unlike white hat hackers, they do so publicly. This alerts malicious actors to the existence of the vulnerability.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Smart devices, such as smartphones, are lucrative targets for hackers. Android devices, in particular, have a more open-source and inconsistent software development process than Apple devices, which puts them at risk of data theft or corruption. However, hackers are increasingly targeting the millions of devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT).</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Webcams</strong></p><p>Webcams built into computers are a common hacking target, mainly because hacking them is a simple process. Hackers typically gain access to a computer using a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) in rootkit malware, which allows them to not only spy on users but also read their messages, see their browsing activity, take screenshots, and hijack their webcam.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Routers</strong></p><p>Hacking routers enables an attacker to gain access to data sent and received across them and networks that are accessed on them. Hackers can also hijack a router to carry out wider malicious acts such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, Domain Name System (DNS) spoofing, or cryptomining.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Email</strong></p><p>Email is one of the most common targets of cyberattacks. It is used to spread malware and ransomware and as a tactic for phishing attacks, which enable attackers to target victims with malicious attachments or links.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Jailbroken phones</strong></p><p>Jailbreaking a phone means removing restrictions imposed on its operating system to enable the user to install applications or other software not available through its official app store. Aside from being a violation of the end-user’s license agreement with the phone developer, jailbreaking exposes many vulnerabilities. Hackers can target jailbroken phones, which allows them to steal any data on the device but also extend their attack to connected networks and systems.</p><p><br></p><h2>Prevention from Getting Hacked</h2><p><br></p><p>There are several key steps and best practices that organizations and users can follow to ensure they limit their chances of getting hacked.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Software update</strong></p><p>Hackers are constantly on the lookout for vulnerabilities or holes in security that have not been seen or patched. Therefore, updating software and operating systems are both crucial to preventing users and organizations from getting hacked. They must enable automatic updates and ensure the latest software version is always installed on all of their devices and programs.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Use unique passwords for different accounts</strong></p><p>Weak passwords or account credentials and poor password practices are the most common cause of data breaches and cyberattacks. It is vital to not only use strong passwords that are difficult for hackers to crack but also to never use the same password for different accounts. Using unique passwords is crucial to limiting hackers’ effectiveness.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>HTTPS encryption</strong></p><p>Spoofed websites are another common vehicle for data theft, when hackers create a scam website that looks legitimate but will actually steal the credentials that users enter. It is important to look for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) prefix at the start of a web address. For example: https://www.fortinet.com.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

  "title": "Role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Cybersecurity",
  "subject": "",
  "bodySection": "<p><strong>Why Is Artificial Intelligence (AI) Important In Cybersecurity?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><em>Artificial intelligence (AI) enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, including making decisions, recognizing human speech, perceiving visual elements, and translating languages</em>. AI uses training data to comprehend context and determine how to respond or react in different situations.</p><p><br></p><p>Artificial intelligence in cybersecurity is increasingly critical to protecting online systems from attacks by cyber criminals and unauthorized access attempts. If used correctly, AI systems can be trained to enable automatic cyber threat detection, generate alerts, identify new strands of malware, and protect businesses’ sensitive data.</p><p><br></p><p>Benefits of artificial intelligence in cybersecurity include leveraging AI techniques—such as deep learning, machine learning (ML), knowledge representation and reasoning, and natural language processing—for a more automated and intelligent cyber defense. In this way, organizations can discover and mitigate the thousands of cyber events that they can come across daily.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h2>How Can AI Help Prevent Cyberattacks?</h2><p>AI in cybersecurity reinforces cyber threat intelligence, enabling security professionals to:</p><p><br></p><p>Search for characteristics of cyberattacks</p><p>Strengthen their defenses</p><p>Analyze data—such as fingerprints, typing styles, and voice patterns—to authenticate users</p><p><br></p><p><em>Cybersecurity automation using AI is safe because it is built on existing use cases in various business environments. For example, human resources (HR) and information technology (IT) teams use AI to</em> onboard new employees and provide them with the resources and appropriate level of access to do their job effectively.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Automation is particularly important in cybersecurity given the ongoing shortage of expert security staff. This allows organizations to enhance their security investments and improve operations without having to worry about finding additional skilled personnel.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The benefits of automating AI in cybersecurity include:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Cost-efficiency</strong>: Pairing cybersecurity with AI results in faster data collection. This makes incident management response more dynamic and efficient. It also removes the need for security professionals to carry out manual, time-consuming tasks so they can focus on more strategic activities that add value to the business.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Removing human error:</strong> A common weakness of traditional security defenses is the need for human intervention, which can lead to costly human error. Artificial intelligence in cybersecurity removes the human element from most security processes. This is a more efficient approach because human resources can be reallocated to where they are most required.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Better decision-making</strong>: Automating cybersecurity helps organizations identify and correct potential deficiencies in their security strategy. In this way, they are able to implement formalized procedures that can result in more secure IT environments.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>However, organizations also need to be aware that cyber criminals adjust their methods to resist new AI cybersecurity tools. Hackers also use AI to create advanced attacks and deploy new and updated forms of malware to target both traditional and AI-enhanced systems.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Applications of AI in Cybersecurity</strong></h2><p><br></p><p><strong>Password protection and authentication</strong></p><p>With AI in cybersecurity, organizations can better protect passwords and secure user accounts through authentication. Most websites include features that allow users to log in to purchase products or contact forms for people to input sensitive data. Extra security layers are necessary to keep their information secure and prevent it from getting into the hands of malicious actors.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>AI tools, such as CAPTCHA, facial recognition, and fingerprint scanners enable organizations to automatically detect whether an attempt to log in to a service is genuine. These solutions help prevent cybercrime tactics like brute-force attacks and credential stuffing, which could put an organization’s entire network at risk.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Phishing detection and prevention control</strong></p><p>Phishing remains one of the biggest cybersecurity threats facing businesses across all industries. AI within email security solutions enables companies to discover anomalies and indicators of malicious messages. It can analyze the content and context of emails to quickly find whether they are spam messages, part of phishing campaigns, or legitimate. For example, AI can quickly and easily identify signs of phishing, such as email spoofing, forged senders, and misspelled domain names.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>ML algorithm techniques allow AI to learn from data to make analysis more accurate and evolve to address new threats. It also helps AI better understand how users communicate, their typical behavior, and textual patterns. This is crucial to preventing more advanced threats like spear phishing, which involves attackers attempting to impersonate high-profile individuals like company CEOs. AI can intercept suspicious activity to prevent a spear-phishing attack before it causes damage to corporate networks and systems.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Vulnerability management</strong></p><p>As cyber criminals deploy more sophisticated methods and techniques, thousands of new vulnerabilities are discovered and reported every year. As a result, businesses struggle to manage the vast volume of new vulnerabilities they encounter every day, and their traditional systems cannot prevent these high-risk threats in real time.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>AI-powered security solutions such as user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) enable businesses to analyze the activity of devices, servers, and users, helping them identify anomalous or unusual behavior that could indicate a zero-day attack. AI in cybersecurity can protect businesses against vulnerabilities they are unaware of before they are officially reported and patched.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Network security</strong></p><p>Network security involves the time-intensive processes of creating policies and understanding the network’s topography. When policies are in place, organizations can enact processes for identifying legitimate connections versus those that may require inspection for potentially malicious behavior. These policies can also help organizations implement and enforce a zero-trust approach to security.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>However, creating and maintaining policies across multiple networks requires a significant amount of time and manual effort. Organizations often do not deploy the correct naming conventions for their applications and workloads. This means security teams may have to spend more time determining which workloads belong to specific applications. AI learns organizations’ network traffic patterns over time, allowing it to recommend the right policies and workloads.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Behavioral analytics</strong></p><p>With behavioral analytics, organizations can identify evolving threats and known vulnerabilities. Traditional security defenses rely on attack signatures and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to discover threats. However, with the thousands of new attacks that cyber criminals launch every year, this approach is not practical.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

  "title": "What Is Blockchain?",
  "subject": "",
  "bodySection": "<p><strong>A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger shared among a computer network's nodes.</strong> They are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions, but they are not limited to cryptocurrency uses. Blockchains can be used to make data in any industry immutable—<a href=\"the term used to describe the inability to be altered.Because there is no way to change a block, the only trust needed is at the point where a user or program enters data.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>the term used to describe the inability to be altered.</em></a></p><p><a href=\"the term used to describe the inability to be altered.Because there is no way to change a block, the only trust needed is at the point where a user or program enters data.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Because there is no way to change a block, the only trust needed is at the point where a user or program enters data.</em></a> This aspect reduces the need for trusted third parties, which are usually auditors or other humans that add costs and make mistakes.</p><p>Since Bitcoin's introduction in 2009, blockchain uses have exploded via the creation of various cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts.</p><p>Key Takeaways</p><p>Blockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a typical database in the way it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks linked together via cryptography.</p><p>Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain, but the most common use for transactions has been as a ledger.&nbsp;</p><p>In Bitcoin’s case, the blockchain is decentralized, so no single person or group has control—instead, all users collectively retain control.</p><p>Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How Does a Blockchain Work?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>You might be familiar with spreadsheets or databases. A blockchain is somewhat similar because it is a database where information is entered and stored. But the key difference between a traditional database or spreadsheet and a blockchain is how the data is structured and accessed.</p><p><br></p><p>A blockchain consists of programs called scripts that conduct the tasks you usually would in a database: Entering and accessing information and saving and storing it somewhere. A blockchain is distributed, which means multiple copies are saved on many machines, and they must all match for it to be valid.</p><p><br></p><p>The Bitcoin blockchain collects transaction information and enters it into a 4MB file called a block (other blockchains use different size blocks). Once it is full, certain information is run through an encryption algorithm, which creates a hexadecimal number called the block header hash.</p><p><br></p><p>The hash is then entered into the following block header and encrypted with the other information in that block's header, creating a chain of blocks.</p><p><br></p><p>Transaction Process</p><p>Transactions follow a specific process, depending on the blockchain they are taking place on. For example, on Bitcoin's blockchain, if you initiate a transaction using your cryptocurrency wallet—the application that provides an interface for the blockchain—it starts a sequence of events.</p><p><br></p><p>In Bitcoin, your transaction is sent to a memory pool, where it is stored and queued until a miner picks it up. Once it is entered into a block and the block fills up with transactions, it is closed, and the mining begins.</p><p><br></p><p>Blockchain</p><p>Every node in the network proposes its own blocks in this way because they all choose different transactions. Each works on their own blocks, trying to find a solution to the difficulty target, using the \"nonce,\" short for number used once.</p><p><br></p><p>The nonce value is a field in the block header that is changeable, and its value incrementally increases every attempt. Every miner starts with a nonce of zero. If the resulting hash isn't equal to or less than the target hash, a value of one is added to the nonce, a new hash is generated, and so on. The nonce rolls over about every 4.5 billion attempts (which takes less than one second) and uses another value called the extra nonce as an additional counter. This continues until a miner generates a valid hash, winning the race and receiving the reward.</p><p><br></p><p>Generating these hashes until a specific value is found is the \"proof-of-work\" you hear so much about—it \"proves\" the miner did the work. The amount of work it takes to validate the hash is why the Bitcoin network consumes so much computational power and energy.</p><p><br></p><p>Once a block is closed, a transaction is complete. However, the block is not considered to be confirmed until five other blocks have been validated. Confirmation takes the network about one hour to complete because it averages just under 10 minutes per block (the first block with your transaction and five following blocks multiplied by 10 equals 60 minutes).</p><p><br></p><p>Not all blockchains follow this process. For instance, the Ethereum network randomly chooses one validator from all users with ether staked to validate blocks, which are then confirmed by the network. This is much faster and less energy intensive than Bitcoin's process.</p><p><br></p><p>Blockchain Decentralization</p><p>A blockchain allows the data in a database to be spread out among several network nodes—computers or devices running software for the blockchain—at various locations. This not only creates redundancy but maintains the fidelity of the data. For example, if someone tries to alter a record at one instance of the database, the other nodes would prevent it from happening because they compare block hashes. This way, no single node within the network can alter information within the chain.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of this distribution—and the encrypted proof that work was done—the information and history (like the transactions in cryptocurrency) are irreversible. Such a record could be a list of transactions (such as with a cryptocurrency), but it is also possible for a non-public blockchain to hold a variety of other information like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company's inventory. Most blockchains wouldn't \"store\" these items; they would likely be sent through a hashing algorithm and represented on the blockchain by a token.</p><p><br></p><p>Blockchain Transparency</p><p>Because of the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin blockchain, all transactions can be transparently viewed by downloading and inspecting them or by using blockchain explorers that allow anyone to see transactions occurring live. Each node has its own copy of the chain that gets updated as fresh blocks are confirmed and added. This means that if you wanted to, you could track a bitcoin wherever it goes.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>For example, exchanges have been hacked in the past, resulting in the loss of large amounts of cryptocurrency. While the hackers may have been anonymous—except for their wallet address—the crypto they extracted is easily traceable because the wallet addresses are published on the blockchain.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, the records stored in the Bitcoin blockchain (as well as most others) are encrypted. This means that only the person assigned an address can reveal their identity. As a result, blockchain users can remain anonymous while preserving transparency.</p><p><br></p><p>Is Blockchain Secure?</p><p>Blockchain technology achieves decentralized security and trust in several ways. To begin with, new blocks are always stored linearly and chronologically. That is, they are always added to the \"end\" of the blockchain. After a block has been added to the end of the blockchain, previous blocks cannot be changed.</p><p><br></p><p>A change in any data changes the hash of the block it was in. Because each block contains the previous block's hash, a change in one would change the following blocks. The network would generally reject an altered block because the hashes would not match. However, this can be accomplished on smaller blockchain networks.</p><p><br></p><p>Not all blockchains are 100% impenetrable. They are distributed ledgers that use code to create the security level they have become known for. If there are vulnerabilities in the coding, they can be exploited.</p><p><br></p><p>A new and smaller chain might be susceptible to this kind of attack, but the attacker would need at least half of the computational power of the network (called a 51% attack). On the Bitcoin and other larger blockchains, this is nearly impossible. By the time the hacker takes any action, the network is likely to have moved past the blocks they were trying to alter. This is because the rate at which these networks hash is exceptionally fast—the Bitcoin network hashed at a rate of 566–657 exahashes per second (18 zeros) between May and June 2024.</p><p>1</p><p><br></p><p>The Ethereum blockchain is not likely to be hacked either—the attackers would need to control more than half of the blockchain's staked ether. Between April and June 2024, more than 32 million ETH was staked by more than one million validators.</p><p>2</p><p>&nbsp;An attacker or group would need to own more than half of the validators, about 16.4 million ETH, and be randomly selected to validate blocks enough times to get their blocks implemented.</p><p><br></p><p>Bitcoin vs. Blockchain</p><p>Blockchain technology was first outlined in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta, two researchers who wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with.</p><p>3</p><p>&nbsp;But it wasn’t until almost two decades later, with the launch of Bitcoin in January 2009, that blockchain had its first real-world application.</p><p><br></p><p>Bitcoin</p><p>The Bitcoin protocol is built on a blockchain. In a research paper introducing the digital currency, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, referred to it as “a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.”</p><p>4</p><p><br></p><p>The key thing to understand is that Bitcoin uses blockchain as a means to transparently record a ledger of payments or other transactions between parties.</p><p><br></p><p>Blockchain</p><p>Blockchain can be used to immutably record any number of data points. This could be in the form of transactions, votes in an election, product inventories, state identifications, deeds to homes, and much more.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, tens of thousands of projects are looking to implement blockchains in various ways to help society other than just recording transactions—for example, as a way to vote securely in democratic elections.</p><p><br></p><p>The nature of blockchain's immutability means that fraudulent voting would become far more difficult. For example, a voting system could work such that each country's citizens would be issued a single cryptocurrency or token.</p><p><br></p><p>Each candidate could then be given a specific wallet address, and the voters would send their token or crypto to the address of whichever candidate they wish to vote for. The transparent and traceable nature of blockchain would eliminate the need for human vote counting and the ability of bad actors to tamper with physical ballots.</p><p><br></p><p>Blockchain vs. Banks</p><p>Blockchains have been heralded as a disruptive force in the finance sector, especially with the functions of payments and banking. However, banks and decentralized blockchains are vastly different.</p><p><br></p><p>To see how a bank differs from blockchain, let’s compare the banking system to Bitcoin’s blockchain implementation.</p><p><br></p><p>How Are Blockchains Used?</p><p>As we now know, blocks on Bitcoin’s blockchain store transactional data. Today, tens of thousands of other cryptocurrency systems are running on a blockchain. But it turns out that blockchain is a reliable way of storing data about other types of transactions.</p><p><br></p><p>Some companies experimenting with blockchain include Walmart, Pfizer, AIG, Siemens, and Unilever, among others. For example, IBM has created its Food Trust blockchain to trace the journey that food products take to get to their locations.</p><p>5</p><p><br></p><p>Why do this? The food industry has seen countless outbreaks of E. coli, salmonella, and listeria; in some cases, hazardous materials were accidentally introduced to foods. In the past, it has taken weeks to find the source of these outbreaks or the cause of sickness from what people are eating.</p><p><br></p><p>Using blockchain allows brands to track a food product’s route from its origin, through each stop it makes, to delivery. Not only that, but these companies can also now see everything else it may have come in contact with, allowing the identification of the problem to occur far sooner—potentially saving lives. This is one example of blockchain in practice, but many other forms of blockchain implementation exist.</p><p><br></p><p>Banking and Finance</p><p>Perhaps no industry stands to benefit from integrating blockchain into its business operations more than personal banking. Financial institutions only operate during business hours, usually five days a week. That means if you try to deposit a check on Friday at 6 p.m., you will likely have to wait until Monday morning to see that money hit your account.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if you make your deposit during business hours, the transaction can still take one to three days to verify due to the sheer volume of transactions that banks need to settle. Blockchain, on the other hand, never sleeps.</p><p><br></p><p>By integrating blockchain into banks, consumers might see their transactions processed in minutes or seconds—the time it takes to add a block to the blockchain, regardless of holidays or the time of day or week. With blockchain, banks also have the opportunity to exchange funds between institutions more quickly and securely. Given the size of the sums involved, even the few days the money is in transit can carry significant costs and risks for banks.</p><p><br></p><p>The settlement and clearing process for stock traders can take up to three days (or longer if trading internationally), meaning that the money and shares are frozen for that period. Blockchain could drastically reduce that time.</p><p><br></p><p>Currency</p><p>Blockchain forms the bedrock for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This design also allows for easier cross-border transactions because it bypasses currency restrictions, instabilities, or lack of infrastructure by using a distributed network that can reach anyone with an internet connection.</p><p><br></p><p>Healthcare</p><p>Healthcare providers can leverage blockchain to store their patients’ medical records securely. When a medical record is generated and signed, it can be written into the blockchain, which provides patients with proof and confidence that the record cannot be changed. These personal health records could be encoded and stored on the blockchain with a private key so that they are only accessible to specific individuals, thereby ensuring privacy.</p><p><br></p><p>Property Records</p><p>If you have ever spent time in your local Recorder’s Office, you will know that recording property rights is both burdensome and inefficient. Today, a physical deed must be delivered to a government employee at the local recording office, where it is manually entered into the county’s central database and public index. In the case of a property dispute, claims to the property must be reconciled with the public index.</p><p><br></p><p>This process is not just costly and time-consuming, it is also prone to human error, where each inaccuracy makes tracking property ownership less efficient. Blockchain has the potential to eliminate the need for scanning documents and tracking down physical files in a local recording office. If property ownership is stored and verified on the blockchain, owners can trust that their deed is accurate and permanently recorded.</p><p><br></p><p>Proving property ownership can be nearly impossible in war-torn countries or areas with little to no government or financial infrastructure and no Recorder’s Office. If a group of people living in such an area can leverage blockchain, then transparent and clear timelines of property ownership could be established.</p><p><br></p><p>Smart Contracts</p><p>A smart contract is computer code that can be built into the blockchain to facilitate transactions. It operates under a set of conditions to which users agree. When those conditions are met, the smart contract conducts the transaction for the users.</p><p><br></p><p>Supply Chains</p><p>As in the IBM Food Trust example, suppliers can use blockchain to record the origins of materials that they have purchased. This would allow companies to verify the authenticity of not only their products but also common labels such as “Organic,” “Local,” and “Fair Trade.”</p><p><br></p><p>As reported by Forbes, the food industry is increasingly adopting the use of blockchain to track the path and safety of food throughout the farm-to-user journey.</p><p>6</p><p><br></p><p>Voting</p><p>As mentioned above, blockchain could facilitate a modern voting system. Voting with blockchain carries the potential to eliminate election fraud and boost voter turnout, as was tested in the November 2018 midterm elections in West Virginia.</p><p>7</p><p><br></p><p>Using blockchain in this way would make votes nearly impossible to tamper with. The blockchain protocol would also maintain transparency in the electoral process, reducing the personnel needed to conduct an election and providing officials with nearly instant results. This would eliminate the need for recounts or any real concern that fraud might threaten the election.</p><p><br></p><p>Pros and Cons of Blockchain</p><p>For all of its complexity, blockchain’s potential as a decentralized form of record-keeping is almost without limit. From greater user privacy and heightened security to lower processing fees and fewer errors, blockchain technology may very well see applications beyond those outlined above. But there are also some disadvantages.</p><p><br></p><p>Pros</p><p>Improved accuracy by removing human involvement in verification</p><p><br></p><p>Cost reductions by eliminating third-party verification</p><p><br></p><p>Decentralization makes it harder to tamper with</p><p><br></p><p>Transactions are secure, private, and efficient</p><p><br></p><p>Transparent technology</p><p><br></p><p>Provides a banking alternative and a way to secure personal information for citizens of countries with unstable or underdeveloped governments</p><p><br></p><p>Cons</p><p>Significant technology cost associated with some blockchains</p><p><br></p><p>Low transactions per second</p><p><br></p><p>History of use in illicit activities, such as on the dark web</p><p><br></p><p>Regulation varies by jurisdiction and remains uncertain</p><p><br></p><p>Data storage limitations</p><p><br></p><p>Benefits of Blockchains</p><p>Accuracy of the Chain</p><p>Transactions on the blockchain network are approved by thousands of computers and devices. This removes almost all people from the verification process, resulting in less human error and an accurate record of information. Even if a computer on the network were to make a computational mistake, the error would only be made to one copy of the blockchain and not be accepted by the rest of the network.</p><p><br></p><p>Cost Reductions</p><p>Typically, consumers pay a bank to verify a transaction or a notary to sign a document. Blockchain eliminates the need for third-party verification—and, with it, their associated costs. For example, business owners incur a small fee when they accept credit card payments because banks and payment-processing companies have to process those transactions. Bitcoin, on the other hand, does not have a central authority and has limited transaction fees.</p><p><br></p><p>Decentralization</p><p>Blockchain does not store any of its information in a central location. Instead, the blockchain is copied and spread across a network of computers. Whenever a new block is added to the blockchain, every computer on the network updates its blockchain to reflect the change.</p><p><br></p><p>By spreading that information across a network, rather than storing it in one central database, blockchain becomes more difficult to tamper with.</p><p><br></p><p>Efficient Transactions</p><p>Transactions placed through a central authority can take up to a few days to settle. If you attempt to deposit a check on Friday evening, for example, you may not actually see funds in your account until Monday morning. Financial institutions operate during business hours, usually five days a week—but a blockchain works 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year.</p><p><br></p><p>On some blockchains, transactions can be completed in minutes and considered secure after just a few. This is particularly useful for cross-border trades, which usually take much longer because of time zone issues and the fact that all parties must confirm payment processing.</p><p><br></p><p>Private Transactions</p><p>Many blockchain networks operate as public databases, meaning anyone with an internet connection can view a list of the network’s transaction history. Although users can access transaction details, they cannot access identifying information about the users making those transactions. It is a common misperception that blockchain networks like Bitcoin are fully anonymous; they are actually pseudonymous because there is a viewable address that can be associated with a user if the information gets out.</p><p><br></p><p>Secure Transactions</p><p>Once a transaction is recorded, its authenticity must be verified by the blockchain network. After the transaction is validated, it is added to the blockchain block. Each block on the blockchain contains its unique hash and the unique hash of the block before it. Therefore, the blocks cannot be altered once the network confirms them.</p><p><br></p><p>Transparency</p><p>Many blockchains are entirely open-source software. This means that everyone can view its code. This gives auditors the ability to review cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for security. However, it also means there is no real authority on who controls Bitcoin’s code or how it is edited. Because of this, anyone can suggest changes or upgrades to the system. If a majority of the network users agree that the new version of the code with the upgrade is sound and worthwhile, then Bitcoin can be updated.</p><p><br></p><p>Private or permission blockchains may not allow for public transparency, depending on how they are designed or their purpose. These types of blockchains might be made only for an organization that wishes to track data accurately without allowing anyone outside of the permissioned users to see it.</p><p><br></p><p>Alternatively, there might come a point where publicly traded companies are required to provide investors with financial transparency through a regulator-approved blockchain reporting system. Using blockchains in business accounting and financial reporting would prevent companies from altering their financials to appear more profitable than they really are.</p><p><br></p><p>Banking the Unbanked</p><p>Perhaps the most profound facet of blockchain and cryptocurrency is the ability for anyone, regardless of ethnicity, gender, location, or cultural background, to use it. According to The World Bank, an estimated 1.4 billion adults do not have bank accounts or any means of storing their money or wealth.</p><p>8</p><p>&nbsp;Moreover, nearly all of these individuals live in developing countries where the economy is in its infancy and entirely dependent on cash.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>These people are often paid in physical cash. They then need to store this physical cash in hidden locations in their homes or other places, incentivizing robbers or violence. While not impossible to steal, crypto makes it more difficult for would-be thieves.</p><p><br></p><p>Drawbacks of Blockchains</p><p>Technology Cost</p><p>Although blockchain can save users money on transaction fees, the technology is far from free. For example, the Bitcoin network's proof-of-work system to validate transactions consumes vast amounts of computational power. In the real world, the energy consumed by the millions of devices on the Bitcoin network is more than Pakistan consumes annually.</p><p>9</p><p><br></p><p>Some solutions to these issues are beginning to arise. For example, bitcoin-mining farms have been set up to use solar power, excess natural gas from fracking sites, or energy from wind farms.</p><p><br></p><p>Speed and Data Inefficiency</p><p>Bitcoin is a perfect case study for the possible inefficiencies of blockchain. Bitcoin's PoW system takes about 10 minutes to add a new block to the blockchain. At that rate, it's estimated that the blockchain network can only manage about seven transactions per second (TPS).</p><p>10</p><p>&nbsp;Although other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, perform better than Bitcoin, blockchain still limits them. Legacy brand Visa, for context, can process 65,000 TPS.</p><p>11</p><p><br></p><p>Solutions to this issue have been in development for years. There are currently blockchain projects that claim tens of thousands of TPS. Ethereum is rolling out a series of upgrades that include data sampling, binary large objects (BLOBs), and rollups. These improvements are expected to increase network participation, reduce congestion, decrease fees, and increase transaction speeds.</p><p>12</p><p><br></p><p>The other issue with many blockchains is that each block can only hold so much data. The block size debate has been and continues to be one of the most pressing issues for the scalability of blockchains in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>Illegal Activity</p><p>While confidentiality on the blockchain network protects users from hacks and preserves privacy, it also allows for illegal trading and activity on the blockchain network. The most cited example of blockchain being used for illicit transactions is probably the Silk Road, an online dark web illegal-drug and money laundering marketplace operating from February 2011 until October 2013, when the FBI shut it down.</p><p>13</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The dark web allows users to buy and sell illegal goods without being tracked by using the Tor Browser and make illicit purchases in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. This is in stark contrast to U.S. regulations, which require financial service providers to obtain information about their customers when they open an account. They are supposed to verify the identity of each customer and confirm that they do not appear on any list of known or suspected terrorist organizations.</p><p>14</p><p><br></p><p>Illicit activity accounted for only 0.34% of all cryptocurrency transactions in 2023.</p><p>15</p><p>This system can be seen as both a pro and a con. It gives anyone access to financial accounts, but allows criminals to transact more easily. Many have argued that the good uses of crypto, like banking the unbanked world, outweigh the bad uses of cryptocurrency, especially when most illegal activity is still accomplished through untraceable cash.</p><p><br></p><p>Regulation</p><p>Many in the crypto space have expressed concerns about government regulation of cryptocurrencies. Several jurisdictions are tightening control over certain types of crypto and other virtual currencies. However, no regulations have yet been introduced that focus on restricting blockchain uses and development, only certain products created using it.</p>",

Get a certification.</h3><p><br></p><p>Another step in the process of landing a cloud job is to get certified. The Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certification is a common one for becoming an IT professional and often a good stepping stone for aspiring cloud professionals.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Read more: What Is the CCNA? An Entry-Level Networking Certification</p><p>Once you’ve got several years of IT and network experience under your belt, you might choose to specialize in one cloud service provider. There are additional certifications for AWS, GCP, and Microsoft Azure which demonstrate to potential employers that you can navigate core concepts, solutions, and tools, as well as governance, privacy, and compliance.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h3>4. Build your own projects and create a cloud portfolio.</h3><p><br></p><p>Once you have a feel for what type of projects you’re interested in taking on in the cloud space, you can start building a portfolio. These projects can be those you worked on in an internship, ones you created on your own, or those that you worked on with a client on a freelance basis.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re already working in the IT field, take the initiative to get involved in cloud-based projects on your team or at your company to develop your skills in a real-life setting. Gather those work examples and put them in a portfolio. Include testimonials if you have them.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h3>5. Gain some work experience.&nbsp;</h3><p><br></p><p>While it’d be nice if everybody who completed a certification and built a portfolio was able to land an internship or entry-level job in cloud computing, these roles are competitive and there are not many of them. Many cloud professionals start out in an IT support or help desk role, then advance into&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-a-network-administrator-a-career-guide\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: var(--cds-color-blue-600);\">network administration</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/articles/network-engineer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: var(--cds-color-blue-600);\">network engineering</a>&nbsp;for years before they’re ready to switch into a cloud engineer role.</p><p><br></p><h3>6. Network.</h3><p><br></p><p>These days, it can be difficult to land a job by applying to them on LinkedIn, Indeed, or a company’s careers page. You might have a higher chance of standing out by connecting with hiring managers. You can do this after you’ve applied, or reach out to cloud professionals you admire on LinkedIn for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/articles/informational-interview\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: var(--cds-color-blue-600);\">informational interviews</a>.</p><p><br></p><h3>7. Apply for jobs.</h3><p><br></p><p>Finally, you’re ready to apply for jobs. You can do this alongside networking, since the two go hand in hand. Consider applying for or advancing into a cloud role within your organization. Get a referral from someone who works at a company you’d like to work for.&nbsp;</p><p>Make sure your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/articles/resume-with-no-experience\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: var(--cds-color-blue-600);\">resume</a>&nbsp;includes your relevant job experiences with clear, specific bullet points detailing your impact (with numbers, like percentage of success rate or number of systems supported).

  "bodySection": "<p>Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>op benefits of cloud computing</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>Cloud computing is a big shift from the traditional way businesses think about IT resources.

This is because cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software and setting up and running onsite datacenters—the racks of servers, the round-the-clock electricity for power and cooling, and the IT experts for managing the infrastructure. It adds up fast.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Speed</strong></p><p>Most cloud computing services are provided self service and on demand, so even vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes, typically with just a few mouse clicks, giving businesses a lot of flexibility and taking the pressure off capacity planning.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Global scale</strong></p><p>The benefits of cloud computing services include the ability to scale elastically. In cloud speak, that means delivering the right amount of IT resources—for example, more or less computing power, storage, bandwidth—right when they’re needed, and from the right&nbsp;<a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/explore/global-infrastructure/geographies/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">geographic location</a>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Productivity</strong></p><p>Onsite datacenters typically require a lot of “racking and stacking”—hardware setup, software patching, and other time-consuming IT management chores. Cloud computing removes the need for many of these tasks, so IT teams can spend time on achieving more important business goals.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Performance</strong></p><p>The biggest cloud computing services run on a worldwide network of secure datacenters, which are regularly upgraded to the latest generation of fast and efficient computing hardware. This offers several benefits over a single corporate datacenter, including reduced network latency for applications and greater economies of scale.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reliability</strong></p><p>Cloud computing makes data backup,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/solutions/backup-and-disaster-recovery/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">disaster recovery</a>, and business continuity easier and less expensive because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider’s network.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Security</strong></p><p>Many cloud providers offer a broad set of policies, technologies, and controls that strengthen your security posture overall, helping protect your data, apps, and infrastructure from potential threats.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Types of cloud computing</strong></p><p>Not all clouds are the same and no single type of cloud computing is right for everyone. Several different models, types, and services have evolved to help offer the right solution for your needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First, you need to determine the type of cloud deployment, or cloud computing architecture, that your cloud services will be implemented on. There are three different ways to deploy cloud services: on a public cloud, private cloud, or hybrid cloud.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-are-private-public-hybrid-clouds/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about public, private, and hybrid clouds</a>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Public cloud</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-a-public-cloud/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Public clouds</a>&nbsp;are owned and operated by third-party&nbsp;<a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/choosing-a-cloud-service-provider\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cloud service providers</a>, which deliver computing resources like servers and storage over the internet. Microsoft Azure is an example of a public cloud. With a public cloud, all hardware, software, and other supporting infrastructure is owned and managed by the cloud provider. You access these services and manage your account using a web browser.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Private cloud</strong></p><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-a-private-cloud/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">private cloud</a>&nbsp;refers to cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single business or organization. A private cloud can be physically located on the company’s onsite datacenter. Some companies also pay third-party service providers to host their private cloud. A private cloud is one in which the services and infrastructure are maintained on a private network.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Hybrid cloud</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-hybrid-cloud-computing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hybrid clouds</a>&nbsp;combine public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them. By allowing data and applications to move between private and public clouds, a hybrid cloud gives your business greater flexibility and more deployment options and helps optimize your existing infrastructure, security, and compliance.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>",

It provides the specifications for the network’s physical components, functional organization, protocols, and procedures.</span></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>What do computer networks do?</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>Computer networks were first created in the late 1950s for use in the military and defense. They were initially used to transmit data over telephone lines and had limited commercial and scientific applications. With the advent of internet technologies, a computer network has become indispensable for enterprises.</p><p>Modern-day network solutions deliver more than connectivity. They are critical for the digital transformation and success of businesses today. Underlying network capabilities have become more programmable, automated, and secure.</p><p>Modern computer networks can:</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Operate virtually</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>The underlying physical network infrastructure can be logically partitioned to create multiple \"overlay\" networks. In an overlay computer network, the nodes are virtually linked, and data can be transmitted between them through multiple physical paths. For example, many enterprise networks are overlaid on the internet.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Integrate on a large scale</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>Modern networking services connect physically distributed computer networks. These services can optimize network functions through automation and monitoring to create one large-scale, high-performance network. Network services can be scaled up or down based on demand.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Respond quickly to changing conditions</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>Many computer networks are software-defined. Traffic can be routed and controlled centrally using a digital interface. These computer networks support virtual traffic management.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Provide data security</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>All networking solutions come with in-built security features like encryption and access control. Third-party solutions like antivirus software, firewalls, and antimalware can be integrated to make the network more secure.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>What are the types of computer network architecture?</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>Computer network design falls under two broad categories:</p><p><br></p><h3>1. <strong>Client-server architecture</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>In this type of computer network, nodes may be servers or clients. Server nodes provide resources like memory, processing power, or data to client nodes. Server nodes may also manage client node behavior. Clients may communicate with each other, but they do not share resources. For example, some computer devices in enterprise networks store data and configuration settings. These devices are the servers in the network. Clients may access this data by making a request to the server machine.</p><p><br></p><h3>2. <strong>Peer-to-peer architecture</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>In Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture, connected computers have equal powers and privileges. There is no central server for coordination. Each device in the computer network can act as either client or server. Each peer may share some of its resources, like memory and processing power, with the entire computer network.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>What is network topology?</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>Depending on the organization's size and requirements, there are three common types of enterprise private networks:</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Local area network (LAN)</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>A LAN is an interconnected system limited in size and geography. It typically connects computers and devices within a single office or building. It is used by small companies or as a test network for small-scale prototyping.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Wide area networks (WAN)</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>An enterprise network spanning buildings, cities, and even countries, is called a wide area network (WAN). While local area networks are used to transmit data at higher speeds within close proximity, WANs are set up for long-distance communication that is secure and dependable.</p><p>SD-WAN or software-defined WAN is virtual WAN architecture controlled by software technologies. An SD-WAN offers more flexible and dependable connectivity services that can be controlled at the application level without sacrificing security and quality of service.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Service provider networks</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>Service provider networks allow customers to lease network capacity and functionality from the provider. Network service providers may consist of telecommunications companies, data carriers, wireless communications providers, Internet service providers, and cable television operators offering high-speed Internet access.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Cloud networks</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>Conceptually, a cloud network can be seen as a WAN with its infrastructure delivered by a cloud-based service. Some or all of an organization’s network capabilities and resources are hosted in a public or private cloud platform and made available on demand. These network resources can include virtual routers, firewalls, bandwidth, and network management software, with other tools and functions available as required.</p><p>Businesses today use cloud networks to accelerate time-to-market, increase scale, and manage costs effectively. The cloud network model has become the standard approach for building and delivering applications for modern enterprises.</p><p><br></p>",
